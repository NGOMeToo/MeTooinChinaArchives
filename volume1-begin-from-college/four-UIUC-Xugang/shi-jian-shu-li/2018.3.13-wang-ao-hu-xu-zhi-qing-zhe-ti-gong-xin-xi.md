徐钢不当行为的信息搜集公告Wesleyan University 王敖教授于几日前在豆辦、知乎等网站发文揭露 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 东亚系教授徐钢(已于 2017 年被取消终身教职)性骚扰,威胁,对学生采取暴力手段近二十年。该文引起了国内外网友的广泛关注,同时我们也意识到,如果想采取法律手段,我们需要更多的受害者和知情人提供证据。由美国法学院学生和律师组成的志愿者团体现在正在搜集信息。如果有知情人或者受害者想要为此提供信息,欢迎实名或者匿名
把信息发至: uiucinfocollct@gmail.com。该邮箱只有一位持有美国执照的律师有登陆权限。我方不会在未经信息提供者允许的情况下,向任何第三方披露提供的信息。

向邮箱投稿不会形成法律雇佣关系。后续如果由律师鉴定能够对徐钢及学校提起民事诉讼,并且当事人自己有意愿,我们会将案子转交给可靠的法律援助机构,或者由我们的律师无偿负责这个案子。如果经过多方考虑,我们不建议使用法律手段,我们将出具中英文报告,转交给 UIUC 和各大机构媒体。在此再次感谢王敖教授和愿意发声的知情人以及受害者,是你们的勇气保护了更多人在未来免受伤害。

**Notice: Seeking Information Regarding Gary Gang Xu's Misconduct**

Gary Gang Xu is a former tenured associate professor at the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), before he was de-tenured in 2017. A recent online article published by associate professor Ao Wang of Wesleyan University revealed that Gary Gang Xu has repeatedly engaged in abusive conducts , including sexual harassment, intimidation, and physical violence, against students for the past two decades. As the revelation drew attention and support from the academic community and beyond, we as a group of volunteers made up of U.S. law practitioners and students have received more information from students, faculties, and Xu' 's previous co-workers. 

In contemplation of potential legal actions, we invite anyone with relevant information to contact us by submitting to uiucinfocollect@gmail.com, either anonymously or with your identity provided. One U.S. licensed attorney will have sole access to the email account. Your information will not be disclosed to any third parties without your consent.

No attorney-client relationship will be formed by submitting to the email address. If the monitoring attorney recommends lawsuits against Gary Gang Xu and/or UIUC based on the information received, we will entrust any legal proceeding to reliable legal aid institutions or selected attorneys on a pro bono basis with the informants’ consent. If legal actions are not advised in the near future, we will issue in-depth reports in Chinese and English to UIUC and other institutions as well as media outlets.

We want to express our utmost appreciation to Prof. Ao Wang and all of the informants and survivors who have spoken out or are coming forward with their stories. Your courage will stop the abuse and make a difference.
